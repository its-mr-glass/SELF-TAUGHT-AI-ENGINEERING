# This is where scientists, engineers and AI models speak the same language - NUMERICAL DATA
# AI isnt magic. its MATH + DATA wrapped in code.
# And these 3 libraries are your toolbox:

# NumPy = Efficient math on arrays/matrices
# Pandas = Load, clean, and analyze data tables.
# Matplotlib = Visualize data

# THis are the reasons python dominates AI because they make DATA TRANFORMATION fast, readbale and powerful
