# Lists, Sets, Dictionaries.
# THis is where you start building memory for an AI brain.

# In AI, the way we organize data is everything.
# Neural networks are layered data structures.
# Pandas DataFrames are glorified lists and dictionaries.

# Week 1 thought me to speakPython, week 2 will teach me how to think with data like a real engineer.

# when i am training AI modules, i handle:
#                                        Thousands of numbers(vectors)
#                                        Millions of records (datasets)
#                                        Word maps (token dicttionaries)
#                                        Uniques sets (lables)
 
# Python's built in data structures: lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries are the core of how we shape that data.
